      <p class="text-center text">Hello my name is Cadyn I wanted to introduce
        myself and talk about me so were not strangers.<br>
        Big thing about me is I love the outdoors I think going to the
        wilderness to escape and see all the animals and nature is the upmost
        relaxing sensation a person can feel. Some of my other passions include
        Spending time with my wife and daughter, learning, working on my cars,
        and making podcast about health and fitness. I grew up in farm town
        called Warren UT and went to Fremont high school. After High school I
        started working in construction and moved into maintenance world where I
        fell in love with learning all the different trades of the construction
        industry. Sadly, this Career field did not hold enough pay for my life
        goals. So, I’ve embarked on a journey to find a career field where I can
        continue to learn a lot of different skills sets and not do the same
        boring things over and over again.
        On my journey I started in business course and like it but I didn’t love
        it so unintentionally
        I walked past the Software development course and researched into it.
        I was enrolled the next day and have loved it ever since. This field has
        challenge me in ways I didn’t expect but I embrace it and
        I am excited for the journey it brings me. Thank you for reading this I
        look forward to Learning more about you!</p>
